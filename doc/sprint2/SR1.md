# Unfinished tasks and group them into stories
Story : STUD-6
This was not a priority ticket so we opted to finish it in sprint 2. 

# What are practices that you should continue during next sprint 
Fast communication and reply time
As many stand ups as our schedule allows. 
Reaching out to team members for help. 
Always writing tests for new features.

# What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
Communicate when there is uncertainty on the best course of action. 
Research the best solution (efficiency, clarity, etc) instead of picking the easiest. This helps other members modify existing functionality and limit the number of bugs.

# What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
Not updating jira as often as we should (log hours, status update, etc)
Not isolating tasks description enough, which has led to occasional overlap of code changes (i.e conflicts). 

# What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1 
Best: Collaborating with members who did their tasks diligently and thus we had no workload stress, but instead an enjoyable learning experience. 
Worst: dealing with technical issues and learning new technologies. Managing our hours on this project at the same time as all the courses we are taking.
