# What are practices that you should continue during next sprint 
Discussing issues as they arise without waiting for the stand up
Fast communication and reply time
Have as many stand ups as our schedule allows. 
Always writing tests for new features.
Communicate when there is uncertainty on the best course of action
Reaching out to team members for help.


# What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
More thorough PR reviews and testing.
More consistent Git commit messages and use of the PR template.
More careful merge conflict resolutions.


# What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
Finishing tasks last-minute.
Not updating jira as often as we should (log hours, status update, etc)
Not isolating tasks description enough, which has led to occasional overlap of code changes (i.e conflicts). 

# What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2
Best: Collaborating with members who did their tasks diligently and thus we had no workload stress, but instead an enjoyable learning experience. Also seeing the great progress we made on the project.
Worst: dealing with technical issues and learning new technologies. Managing our hours on this project at the same time as all the courses we are taking.
