# What are practices that you should continue during next sprint 
Fast communication and reply time
Always writing tests for new features.
Communicate when there is uncertainty on the best course of action
Discussing issues as they arise without waiting for the stand up
Reaching out to team members for help.
Have as many stand ups as our schedule allows. 
Continue to update the documentation with each new feature/task.  


# What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
Being more careful during merge conflict resolutions so someone’s work doesn’t get deleted or broken.
More thorough PR reviews.

# What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
Finishing tasks and deliverables at the last-minute.
Not updating jira as often as we should (log hours, status update, etc)
Not isolating tasks description enough, which has led to occasional overlap of code changes (i.e conflicts). 

# What was your best/worst experience during sprint 3
Best: Collaborating with members who did their tasks diligently and thus we had no workload stress, but instead an enjoyable learning experience. Also seeing the great progress we made on the project.
Worst: Managing our hours on this project at the same time as all the courses we are taking.
