# Sprint 1 Release Planning Meeting

### Release Goal: April 8th 

## Project Scope
Our release plan is to include the majority of user stories, if not all. The final release should be expected to handle multiple users and maintain the expected behavior. 

In order to ensure at least the minimums expectation is met, we need the following features to have been built and polished: 

Users' dashboard should be personalized depending on the user. Study groups on the dashboard (i.e home) are chosen based on criteria such as “near me”. 
Users are able to create and customize their own study groups with features such as: set as a recurring event, Official study-group, capacity control, select date/time and choose location through an interactive map.
Users are given numerous ways to search for the perfect study-groups (through means of filters and interactive maps).  
Map should be indicative of information such as the group is full, public, private, official and so on. 
Responsive, mobile friendly website.
Users can personalize their profiles and make new connections through the app.
## Out of Scope
