Eventbrite and Meetup are a self-service ticketing platform for live experiences that allows anyone to create, share, find and attend events. Students can create study groups as “events” using both competitors, but we will cover why our product is superior for the student demographic.

  

### How is our product different?

  

StudyTogether is a **student-friendly** alternative for coordinating study-groups. It provides students and educators a platform to help facilitate a collaborative environment (online or in-person) for learning. Students can provide their desired location and view all study groups near that location through an interactive in-browser map. Students also have access to many study-group configurations and customization such as filtering by course code, sharing groups with certain users only, and more.

  

Although both StudyTogether and our competitors share the same “event booking”, our platform solves a fundamental issue with our competition, they are cluttered with irrelevant content. Both Eventbrite and meetup are filled with all types of events out there, hindering the student’s experience when hunting down a specific study session. The standard solution is to rely on recommendations and generic filtering. Our solution is to break down the platform, that is, create a separate platform that is dedicated just for the student demographic. Our focus on a smaller demographic allows us to provide personalized features and a better user experience.

  
  

**Specific scenarios and users where our products exceeds competitors:**

  

* S1: Assume Linus (**a student**) is taking CSC209 and has a midterm coming up, they login and create a study group for 5 people at a given location and time. Other users can then search through using the CSC209 tag, and when they click it, it brings up a description and a map displaying its location to see if it matches their needs.

  

Notice how easy it was for Linus to find a study group using StudyTogether, there was no noise in the form of irrelevant events Linus had to filter through just to find a study group. There was no need for a generic filtering system. Other competitors such as Eventbrite can't provide this service due to their business model. Majority of Event/ticket based services aim for a larger demographic, so there is no custom filtering for each demographic.

  

* S2: Assume Tobey (**an official TA**) wants to host a study group for an upcoming test, but would like only people from a certain campus to join (e.g UTSG), to do so they go to “group configuration” and customize the visibility setting such that only those students (from UTSG) can register.

  

This type of customization is another example of our student-centric approach that other competitors can’t provide. The larger the demographic, the more generalized the features become. So it is very unlikely for already established services (such as competitors) to provide what we promise.
