Part 1: The Project Objective

An application that facilitates the process of forming study groups at a university. Users will be able to form their own study groups that others can then view and request to join. Users can easily filter through study groups using specific fields like dates, times, courses, topics, locations etc, and request to join the study group that’s perfect for them! 

Part 2: The Key Personas **(MAOR)**



1. **First Persona: Linus Sebastian**

    Linus is an eighteen year old student who has just started his first year as a double-major in Computer Science and Statistics in the University of Toronto Mississauga. He used to have a lot of friends in high school whom he formed study groups with in order to remain focused and motivated, and ease his procrastination problems, but after having transitioned to University, did not get a chance to meet new people. Linus hopes to find new friends who he could both study with and share a meal.

2. **Second Persona: Tobey Maguire**

    Nineteen year old Tobey, who is a Commerce student and teaching assistant hopes to find an easily accessible website which he could share with students in courses he teaches in order to increase his office hours attendance rate. Furthermore, he also wishes to have a rough estimation of how many students will show up, which will help him plan the office hour agenda accordingly.

3. **Third Persona: Adjoa Andoh**

    Sixty-four year old Adjoa, who is a soon-to-be retired and passionate high school teacher that has been working in the education sector for almost forty years hopes to keep teaching once in a while at a local university in her city after her retirement, and maintain a passive income.


     


Part 3: The Key Scenarios

Linus has a midterm coming up for his CSC301 (a computer science course at the University of Toronto) course and he would like to find a group of like-minded individuals to study with. He doesn’t know too many people who are taking the course and needs some help meeting people who would like to study with him.

Tobey is a TA for CSC209, and wanted to host additional office hours before a midterm. He would like a tool to allow him to let students know that these office hours will be taking place.

Adjoa would like to tutor students at her local university and would like some way to advertise her services and form a small group of students. 

Part 4: The Key Principles



* Intuitive and efficient study group search/creation tools :
    * Ensure that the process for creating and searching for study groups is quick and simple. 
    * Give users tools that they can use to effectively find the perfect study group for them. (Good search filters, an interactive map with study groups displayed as markers, etc)
    * All users should be able to easily access all the features through a simple and clear interface with no clutter on screen. 
* Privacy
    * Provide various options for users that will protect their privacy and keep them safe.
        * For example, only display study group posting to users with a verified …@mail.utoronto.ca email, or people who are taking the same course as you, etc.
        * Another example, choose whether to display your real name or an alias, gender, etc.
