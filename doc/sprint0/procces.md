**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?  \
</span>**

Our team was divided into three 3 main roles:  




* **Backend:** handles building out APIs, setting up/configuring hosting env, Devops related tasks, etc..
* **Frontend:** handles client-side tasks. Utilizing tools such as React, Redux, Javascript, HTML/CSS, etc
* **Fullstack**: a more well-rounded individual that has more comprehensive knowledge and can easily hop on to assist on any task (both client side and server side). 

Front-end

    Milind

Back-end

    Issa, John

Full Stack 

    Maor, Milind, Daniel 

 


Within those 3 main roles, we also assigned more specific roles such as 




* **DevOps**: Handles tasks such as deployment and infrastructure. 
    * Daniel 
* **UI/UX design**: Handles the overall structure as well as appearance and interaction for the website. 
    * Maor
    * Milind 


For communication, our team relied on **Discord** and **Google Docs** to create roles and then let members choose themselves what roles they were more comfortable with. We made sure to have a balanced role assignment so we don’t create bottlenecks. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How did you make decisions?</span>**

Our decision making involves 3 phases: 



1. Jamboard 
2. Discord discussion
3. Meeting

**Phase 1**: Before a decision is made, our process involves creating a shared document that will act as our jamboard. We begin by letting every member contribute any information or comments they would like others to consider. Once the jamboard phase is done, this means all members have shared critical information. 

**Phase 2**: Once all the members have read the Google doc and everybody is on the same page, we now use Discord messages as a way to get small questions or clarifications out of the way. This phase allows us to eliminate any confusion or misunderstanding that can waste scarce time in the last phase. 

**Phase 3**: This phase is where the final decisions are made. We first plan a meeting (once a week) that will take place in a Discord call where all members will be present. Once all members are gathered, we go over the past phases and gather what each member has concluded is best. Once everybody shares their conclusion, we begin a vote to decide on what the majority of members thinks is best. And unless an opposing member has an objection, we proceed with the final decision.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?</span>**

We defined priority based on a simple ten point scale. Stories that are absolutely essential to our application (such as the ability to make/join a study group) were given a very high priority (8-10). Then stories that we thought users would really want were given a somewhat high rating (6-7). Finally, stories that we thought would be nice to have, but were not essential were given a low rating (1-5). We agreed on the priority of most stories, but on the few that we disagreed on, we would have a small discussion and then a round of voting. It never took more than one round to come to a consensus.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> How frequently did you meet?</span>**

Our meetings were held once a week at an agreed upon time to ensure every member is available to attend (this meeting also happens to be **phase 3**, which was discussed above). This was sufficient since most of the discussion was done over Discord. We organized the meetings through a shared meeting agenda that we used as a guide. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">What lessons should you take forward to the next phase? </span>**

We learned how to work as a team and make group decisions from choosing a project idea to deciding points and priorities. We had a lot of communication through our Discord outside of meetings which we found very helpful for answering each others’ questions. The biggest lesson we learned was to always have a detailed agenda before meetings. Meetings went much more smoothly and were much shorter when they were planned in advance.
